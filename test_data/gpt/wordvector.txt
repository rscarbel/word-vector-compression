start by standardizing the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This ensures that all variables have equal weight in the analysis. Next, we compute the covariance matrix, which measures the degree to which pairs of variables vary together. The principal components are then obtained by performing an eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix. This yields a set of eigenvectors, which represent the directions of maximum variation in the data, and their corresponding eigenvalues, which represent the amount of variation explained by each eigenvector.

We can use the principal components to reduce the dimensionality of the data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional space. We select the top k principal components that explain the most variation and discard the rest.
